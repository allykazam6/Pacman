# Pacman

### Description

Welcome to my Pacmen Exercise.  This features multiple pacmans as they move across the screen, bouncing from one edge to the other.  When they hit the left or right side of the screen, they turn around and start towards the opposite side of the screen.


### How to run

Open up index.html, clicking on "Add Pacman", adds a new pacman to the screen.  The button "Start Game", starts the Pacmans moving across the scereen while chomping their mouths.
